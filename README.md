# Crossy Road Game using Python Turtle üöóüê¢
Welcome to my version of Crossy Road built with Python's Turtle graphics module! This project replicates the classic arcade game where you control a character trying to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. Here's what you need to know to get started:

## Features
**Random Car Motion:** Cars move randomly across the screen, making each playthrough unique.

**Collision Detection:** The game checks for collisions between the player (turtle) and cars to determine if the player survives or gets hit.
**Scoreboard Mechanism:** Tracks and displays the number of successful crossings.
**Game Restart Mechanism:** Allows the player to restart the game after winning or losing.
**Dynamic Car Traffic:** Traffic intensity increases with each level, providing a greater challenge.
**Dynamic Car Speeds:** Cars move faster as you progress through the game, adding to the difficulty.

## Controls
Use the up arrow key to move the turtle (player) upwards and attempt to cross the road.
